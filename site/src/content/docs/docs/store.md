OntoSkills uses a simple distribution model:

- **OntoStore** — built in by default
- **Third-party stores** — added explicitly
- **Source imports** — cloned and compiled locally

---

## Store types

### OntoStore (built-in)

OntoStore ships with the product. No configuration needed.

```bash
ontoskills search hello
ontoskills install mareasw/greeting/hello
```

Skills are automatically enabled on install.

**Package ID format:** `author/package/skill`

Example: `obra/superpowers/test-driven-development`

### Third-party stores

Opt-in stores maintained by other teams or communities.

```bash
# Add a store
ontoskills store add-source acme https://example.com/index.json

# List configured stores
ontoskills store list
```

Third-party packages use the same ID format and install flow.

### Source imports

Raw repositories with `SKILL.md` files, compiled locally.

```bash
ontoskills import-source https://github.com/user/skill-repo
```

- Cloned to `~/.ontoskills/skills/author/`
- Compiled to `~/.ontoskills/ontologies/author/`
- Requires OntoCore compiler installed

---

## Package lifecycle

### Install

```bash
ontoskills install obra/superpowers/test-driven-development
```

Downloads compiled `.ttl` from the store and places it in `~/.ontoskills/ontologies/`.

To install without downloading embedding artifacts:

```bash
ontoskills install obra/superpowers/test-driven-development --no-embeddings
```

Install resolution supports three levels:

| Level | Example | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Author | `anthropics` | Installs all packages from that author |
| Package | `anthropics/claude-code` | Installs all skills in the package |
| Full | `anthropics/claude-code/agent-development` | Installs the exact skill |

### Enable / Disable

```bash
ontoskills disable obra/superpowers/test-driven-development
ontoskills enable obra/superpowers/test-driven-development
```

Skills are enabled by default on install. Use `disable` to hide a skill from OntoMCP without removing it. Use `enable` to re-enable.

### Update

```bash
ontoskills update obra/superpowers/test-driven-development
```

Fetches the latest version from the store.

### Remove

```bash
ontoskills remove obra/superpowers/test-driven-development
```

Deletes the package from local storage.

### Rebuild index

```bash
ontoskills rebuild-index
```

Regenerates `~/.ontoskills/ontologies/system/index.enabled.ttl` from all enabled skills. Run this if you manually modified `.ttl` files.

    └── registry.lock.json
```

---

## Store index format

Stores serve a static `index.json`:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "package_id": "obra/superpowers",
      "manifest_path": "packages/obra/superpowers/package.json",
      "trust_tier": "official"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Package not found"

- Check the package ID spelling
- Run `ontoskills search <query>` to discover available packages
- If using third-party store, verify it's configured: `ontoskills store list`

### "Skill not visible in MCP"

If a skill was disabled, re-enable it:

```bash
ontoskills enable obra/superpowers/test-driven-development
ontoskills rebuild-index
```

### "Source import failed"

Ensure OntoCore is installed:

```bash
ontoskills install core
```

Then retry the import.

### "ONNX Runtime error"

If you see errors about ONNX Runtime native libraries, set the library path to the **directory** containing the shared library:

```bash
export ORT_DYLIB_PATH=/path/to/onnxruntime/lib
```

This is only needed when built with `--features embeddings` for semantic search.

### "Index corrupted"

Rebuild from scratch:

```bash
ontoskills rebuild-index
```

## Practical rules

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `install mcp` | Installs the MCP runtime |
| `install core` | Installs the compiler |
| `install <id>` | Installs a compiled package |
| `import-source <url>` | Clones and compiles source |
| `enable` / `disable` | Controls MCP visibility |
| OntoStore | Built-in, never needs `store add-source` |
