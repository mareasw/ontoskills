OntoSkills uses a simple distribution model:

- **OntoStore** — built in by default
- **Third-party stores** — added explicitly
- **Source imports** — cloned and compiled locally

---

## Store Types

### OntoStore (Built-in)

OntoStore ships with the product. No configuration needed.

```bash
ontoskills search hello
ontoskills install mareasw/greeting/hello
```

Skills are automatically enabled on install.

**Package ID format:** `owner/repo/skill`

Example: `mareasw/office/xlsx`

### Third-Party Stores

Opt-in stores maintained by other teams or communities.

```bash
# Add a store
ontoskills store add-source acme https://example.com/index.json

# List configured stores
ontoskills store list

# Remove a store
ontoskills store remove-source acme
```

Third-party packages use the same ID format and install flow.

### Source Imports

Raw repositories with `SKILL.md` files, compiled locally.

```bash
ontoskills import-source https://github.com/user/skill-repo
```

- Cloned to `~/.ontoskills/skills/vendor/`
- Compiled to `~/.ontoskills/ontologies/vendor/`
- Requires OntoCore compiler installed

---

## Package Lifecycle

### Install

```bash
ontoskills install mareasw/office/xlsx
```

Downloads compiled `.ttl` from the store and places it in `~/.ontoskills/ontologies/`.

### Enable / Disable

```bash
ontoskills disable mareasw/office/xlsx
ontoskills enable mareasw/office/xlsx
```

Skills are enabled by default on install. Use `disable` to hide a skill from OntoMCP without removing it. Use `enable` to re-enable.

### Update

```bash
ontoskills update mareasw/office/xlsx
```

Fetches the latest version from the store.

### Remove

```bash
ontoskills remove mareasw/office/xlsx
```

Deletes the package from local storage.

### Rebuild Index

```bash
ontoskills rebuild-index
```

Regenerates `index.enabled.ttl` from all enabled skills. Run this if you manually modified `.ttl` files.

## Local Layout

```text
~/.ontoskills/
├── bin/                    # Managed binaries
│   └── ontomcp
├── core/                   # Compiler runtime (optional)
├── ontologies/             # Compiled ontologies
│   ├── ontoskills-core.ttl

└── state/                  # Metadata and locks
    ├── registry.sources.json
    └── registry.lock.json
```

## Store Index Format

Stores serve a static `index.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "packages": [
    {
      "id": "mareasw/office/xlsx",
      "name": "xlsx",
      "description": "Excel file generation skill",
      "version": "1.2.0",
      "url": "https://github.com/mareasw/ontoskills/releases/download/xlsx-1.2.0/xlsx.ttl"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Package not found"

- Check the package ID spelling
- Run `ontoskills search <query>` to discover available packages
- If using third-party store, verify it's configured: `ontoskills store list`

### "Skill not visible in MCP"

If a skill was disabled, re-enable it:

```bash
ontoskills enable mareasw/office/xlsx
ontoskills rebuild-index
```

### "Source import failed"

Ensure OntoCore is installed:

```bash
ontoskills install core
```

Then retry the import.

### "Index corrupted"

Rebuild from scratch:

```bash
ontoskills rebuild-index
```

## Practical Rules

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `install mcp` | Installs the MCP runtime |
| `install core` | Installs the compiler |
| `install <id>` | Installs a compiled package |
| `import-source <url>` | Clones and compiles source |
| `enable` / `disable` | Controls MCP visibility |
| OntoStore | Built-in, never needs `store add-source` |
