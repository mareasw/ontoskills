description: Protocol for interacting with the OntoSkills MCP server to discover, evaluate, and compose skills from the compiled knowledge graph.

## OVERVIEW

The OntoSkills MCP server exposes a knowledge graph of compiled skills. This document teaches you how to use its 4 tools effectively to find, evaluate, and compose skills for any task.

## AVAILABLE MCP TOOLS

### 1. search_skills(query: string) -> Vec<SkillSearchResult>

Semantic search across all compiled skills. Returns matching skills with relevance indicators.

**When to use:** When you need to find skills that address a user's intent or task requirement.

**Best practices:**
- Use natural language queries that describe the GOAL, not the tool name
- Example: "create a presentation from data" is better than "pptx"
- If results are sparse, try synonyms or broader terms
- Call this FIRST before any other MCP tool

### 2. get_skill_context(skill_id: string, include_content: bool = false) -> SkillContextResult

Returns full details for a specific skill: metadata, knowledge nodes, state transitions, dependencies, and optionally full content blocks (code, tables, flowcharts, templates).

**When to use:** After search_skills identified candidate skills, to evaluate fitness.

**Best practices:**
- Start with include_content=false (default) to get summaries
- Only set include_content=true when you've decided to USE the skill and need the actual code/templates
- Always check requiresState before attempting execution
- Read ALL knowledge nodes with severity CRITICAL or HIGH before proceeding

**Response structure:**
- `skill_details`: name, description, category, intents, aliases
- `payload`: executor type and code (for executable skills)
- `knowledge_nodes`: epistemic rules (standards, anti-patterns, constraints, heuristics, etc.)
- `content_blocks`: summary of available code examples, tables, flowcharts, templates
- `state_transitions`: requiresState (preconditions), yieldsState (outcomes), handlesFailure

### 3. evaluate_execution_plan(plan: ExecutionPlan) -> ExecutionPlanEvaluation

Validates a proposed execution plan against the skill knowledge graph. Checks state chains, dependencies, and identifies missing prerequisites.

**When to use:** Before executing a multi-skill workflow, to verify the plan is sound.

**Best practices:**
- Include ALL skills in the plan, even "obvious" ones
- Check the `applicable` field — if false, review `missing_states` and `warnings`
- Pay attention to `recommended_skill` — the graph may suggest a better alternative
- Review `plan_steps` for the correct execution order

**Plan structure:**
```json
{
  "steps": [
    {"skill_id": "skill-name", "description": "what this step accomplishes"},
    ...
  ]
}
```

### 4. query_epistemic_rules(context: string, kind: string = None, severity: string = None) -> Vec<KnowledgeNodeInfo>

Queries knowledge rules across all skills, optionally filtered by type and severity.

**When to use:** When you need best practices, constraints, or warnings for a specific domain/context.

**Best practices:**
- Use specific context strings: "when modifying Excel files" is better than "excel"
- Filter by severity="CRITICAL" first to catch hard constraints
- Filter by kind to get specific rule types: "AntiPattern", "Constraint", "SecurityImplication"
- This tool searches ACROSS skills — it finds rules from any skill that matches the context

## WORKFLOW

### Discovery Phase
1. Call `search_skills` with the user's intent
2. For each match (up to 5), call `get_skill_context(skill_id)` with include_content=false
3. Evaluate: check intents alignment, requiresState preconditions, category relevance
4. Select the best 1-3 candidates

### Planning Phase
5. Build an execution plan with selected skills
6. Call `evaluate_execution_plan` to validate
7. If `applicable=false`: address missing_states, resolve warnings, re-evaluate
8. For CRITICAL/HIGH knowledge nodes: internalize the rules before proceeding

### Execution Phase
9. Call `get_skill_context(skill_id, include_content=true)` for skills you'll execute
10. Follow ordered procedures (stepOrder) if present
11. Respect all knowledge nodes — especially AntiPatterns and Constraints
12. After execution, verify yieldsState matches expected outcomes

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

- **Skipping search_skills:** Don't guess skill names. Always search first.
- **Ignoring requiresState:** Executing a skill without its preconditions leads to failures.
- **Overlooking CRITICAL knowledge nodes:** These are hard constraints, not suggestions.
- **Not validating plans:** Multi-skill workflows can have broken state chains.
- **Requesting full content too early:** Only request include_content=true when you're committed to using a skill.
- **Assuming skill availability:** Search results only include compiled and enabled skills.

## STATE TRANSITION SEMANTICS

Skills form a state machine via requiresState/yieldsState:
- `requiresState`: What MUST be true before execution (preconditions)
- `yieldsState`: What BECOMES true after successful execution (outcomes)
- `handlesFailure`: What states indicate execution failure

State chaining: Skill A's yieldsState should match Skill B's requiresState for valid sequencing.
If evaluate_execution_plan reports `missing_states`, you need to find or ensure skills that yield those states.

## CONTENT BLOCK TYPES

When include_content=true, responses may contain:
- **CodeExample**: Inline code with language, purpose, and usage context
- **Table**: Markdown tables with raw source (can be reconstructed)
- **Flowchart**: Graphviz or Mermaid diagrams encoding decision flows
- **Template**: Reusable prompt/output templates with variable placeholders
- **Workflow**: Ordered procedure steps with dependencies

Use these to execute the skill without reading the original SKILL.md.
