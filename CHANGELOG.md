## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-18

### Changed

#### CLI Tooling Updates for Knowledge Nodes

Updated the PR #5 tooling to work with the current ontology structure (knowledge_nodes and requirements):

- **core/explainer.py** — Updated `SkillSummary` to extract:
  - `knowledge_nodes`: list of `KnowledgeNodeSummary` (node_type, directive_content, applies_to_context, has_rationale, severity_level)
  - `requirements`: list of `RequirementSummary` (requirement_value, is_optional)
  - Removed: `depends_on`, `extends`, `contradicts` (not used in current skills)

- **core/differ.py** — Updated drift detection:
  - Fixed `_diff_requirements()` to use `oc:hasRequirement` instead of `oc:requires`
  - Added `_diff_knowledge_nodes()` to track `oc:impartsKnowledge` changes (cosmetic)
  - Updated SPARQL queries in suggestions to use correct properties

- **core/linter.py** — Updated checks:
  - Replaced `orphan-skill` with `unreachable-state` check (skills with unreachable required states)
  - Kept: `dead-state`, `circular-dep`, `duplicate-intent` (still valid)

- **core/graph_export.py** — Changed from dependency graph to state transition graph:
  - Edges now show: Skill A `yieldsState` X → Skill B `requiresState` X
  - Visualizes actual execution flow between skills

- **core/tests/** — Updated all test files for the new functionality

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- Added repo-local `.env` loading for the Python compiler so extraction and security checks can
  read `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, and model overrides without manual shell exports
- Added `.env.example` with the compiler variables needed for Anthropic-compatible providers

### Changed

- Updated compiler documentation with `.env`-based configuration and an example nested-skill
  compile command
- Updated Claude Code MCP troubleshooting guidance to call out stale background processes after
  rebuilding the Rust server
- Relaxed SHACL state validation to allow novel states (e.g., `oc:SpreadsheetCreated`) without
  requiring them to be pre-defined in the core ontology - the MCP server resolves states at runtime
- Updated README.md validation table to reflect relaxed state constraints (IRI required, not
  necessarily `oc:State` instance)

### Fixed

- Fixed Rust MCP `tools/call` responses so `structuredContent` is always a record object, avoiding
  Claude Code schema errors for tools returning arrays such as `list_skills` and
  `find_skills_by_intent`
- Fixed pySHACL validation bug where RDFS inference caused Literal values in dependency relations
  to be treated as focus nodes for validation - now uses `inference='none'`
- Fixed SHACL `sh:class oc:State` constraint that rejected novel states extracted by LLM -
  removed class constraint, keeping only `sh:nodeKind sh:IRI`
- Fixed skill dependency serialization to use Literal strings instead of URIRef to prevent
  pySHACL from validating them as skill nodes
- Fixed duplicate `skill_output_paths` entries when skills were skipped due to hash match

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

#### Static Linter (`ontoskills lint`)

Analyses the compiled ontology without calling the Anthropic API.
Catches structural issues before they reach runtime or waste API tokens.

- **core/linter.py** — `lint_ontology(ttl_path) → LintResult`
  - `dead-state` (warning): skill requiresState X but no skill yieldsState X
  - `circular-dep` (error): cycle detected in oc:dependsOn graph via DFS
  - `duplicate-intent` (error): two skills resolve the same intent string
  - `orphan-skill` (info): isolated skill with no dependents and unreachable states
- **core/tests/test_linter.py** — 6 tests
- **core/cli.py** — `lint` command: `--ontology`, `--format` (rich/json), `--errors-only`
  - Exit code 1 when errors found (CI gate)

#### Dependency Graph Visualiser (`ontoskills graph`)

Exports the skill relationship graph as Mermaid or Graphviz DOT.

- **core/graph_export.py** — `build_graph(ttl_path, fmt, skill_filter) → str`
  - Covers oc:dependsOn (solid arrow), oc:extends (dashed), oc:contradicts (bidirectional)
  - Deduplicates symmetric contradicts edges
  - Optional 1-hop `skill_filter` for subgraph output
- **core/tests/test_graph_export.py** — 7 tests
- **core/cli.py** — `graph` command: `--ontology`, `--format` (mermaid/dot), `--skill`, `--output`

#### Skill Explainer (`ontoskills explain <skill-id>`)

Renders a Rich summary card for a compiled skill without reading raw Turtle.

- **core/explainer.py** — `explain_skill(ttl_path, skill_id) → SkillSummary | None`
  - Extracts: intents, requiresState, yieldsState, handlesFailure, dependsOn,
    extends, contradicts, executor (from payload node), contentHash, generatedBy
  - `list_skill_ids(ttl_path)` — lists all available skill IDs for autocomplete/error hints
- **core/tests/test_explainer.py** — 9 tests
- **core/cli.py** — `explain` command: positional `SKILL_ID`, `--ontology`
  - Prints available IDs when skill not found

#### Migration Guidance (`ontoskills diff --suggest`)

Extends the Skill Drift Detector with actionable remediation for breaking changes.

- **core/differ.py** — `MigrationSuggestion` dataclass + `DriftReport.suggestions()`
  - `skill-removed`: SPARQL to find agents with oc:dependsOn pointing to removed skill
  - `intent-renamed`: SPARQL to find callers of the old intent string
  - `requirement-added`: SPARQL to find skills with the new oc:requires relationship
- **core/drift_report.py** — `print_suggestions()` Rich-formatted output
- **core/cli.py** — `--suggest` flag on `diff` command
- **core/tests/test_differ.py** — 4 new suggestion tests
- **core/tests/test_cli.py** — 1 new CLI test for `--suggest`
#### Local MCP Server

- Added a new **Rust-based local MCP server** under `mcp/`
  - Loads compiled OntoSkills ontologies from `.ttl` files
  - Speaks MCP over `stdio`
  - Auto-discovers `ontoskills/` from the current directory and its parents
  - Can also be pointed at a custom ontology root with `--ontology-root`

#### MCP Tooling

- Implemented MCP tools for semantic skill discovery and planning:
  - `list_skills`
  - `find_skills_by_intent`
  - `get_skill`
  - `get_skill_requirements`
  - `get_skill_transitions`
  - `get_skill_dependencies`
  - `get_skill_conflicts`
  - `find_skills_yielding_state`
  - `find_skills_requiring_state`
  - `check_skill_applicability`
  - `plan_from_intent`
  - `get_skill_payload`

#### Planning Engine

- Added state-aware planning inside the Rust MCP catalog:
  - checks `requiresState` against caller-provided current states
  - finds preparatory skills through `yieldsState`
  - ranks candidate plans by unresolved states and step count
  - prefers direct skills over setup-heavy alternatives when possible

#### Rust Test Coverage

- Added Rust unit tests for:
  - intent lookup
  - payload lookup
  - planning with preparatory skills
  - planner ranking preference for direct skills

### Changed

#### Documentation

- Updated `README.md` to reflect that `mcp/` is now implemented
- Added MCP usage, run commands, and verification instructions
- Updated `mcp/README.md` with scope, tool list, auto-discovery behavior, and run instructions
- Added `mcp/CLAUDE_CODE_GUIDE.md` with build, run, registration, verification, and troubleshooting steps for Claude Code

#### MCP Compatibility

- Updated the Rust MCP server to support Claude Code's current handshake behavior
  - supports protocol version `2025-11-25`
  - accepts line-delimited JSON requests on `stdio` in addition to framed `Content-Length` transport
  - replies using the same wire mode used by the client
  - exposes empty `resources/list`, `resources/templates/list`, and `prompts/list` endpoints for client compatibility

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

#### Skill Drift Detector (`ontoskills diff`)

Semantic diffing system that compares two versions of the compiled ontology
and classifies every change by its impact on agents querying the graph.

- **core/snapshot.py** — Snapshot manager
  - `save_snapshot(ttl_path)`: saves a timestamped, SHA-256-hashed copy of
    `index.ttl` into `.ontoskills/snapshots/` after every successful compile
  - `get_latest_snapshot()`: returns the second-to-last snapshot (baseline
    for the next diff)
  - `_prune_snapshots(keep=10)`: keeps only the 10 most recent snapshots

- **core/differ.py** — Semantic diff engine
  - `SkillChange` dataclass: `skill_id`, `change_type` (breaking / additive /
    cosmetic), `category`, `description`, `old_value`, `new_value`
  - `DriftReport` dataclass: aggregates changes with `has_breaking` and
    `is_clean` properties
  - `compute_diff(old_ttl, new_ttl)`: loads two RDF graphs and diffs them
    across four semantic axes — intents, requiresState/yieldsState, oc:requires,
    and skill presence
  - Removed intent → breaking; added intent → additive
  - Added oc:requires → breaking; removed oc:requires → additive
  - Removed skill entirely → breaking; new skill → additive

- **core/drift_report.py** — Report formatter
  - `print_report()`: Rich-formatted terminal output with colour-coded panels
    and summary table
  - `export_json()`: serialises `DriftReport` to JSON for CI/CD pipelines

- **core/cli.py** — `diff` command and compile hook
  - New `diff` command with options: `--from`, `--to`, `--breaking-only`,
    `--format` (rich/json/md), `--output`
  - Exit code 9 on breaking changes (pipeline gate)
  - `save_snapshot()` hook added to `compile`: every successful compile
    automatically creates a snapshot

- **core/exceptions.py** — `DriftDetectedError(SkillETLError)`, exit code 9

- **core/tests/test_differ.py** — 5 unit tests for the differ module
- **core/tests/test_cli.py** — 6 CLI tests for the `diff` command
### Breaking Changes

#### Output Filename Change

- **`skill.ttl` → `ontoskill.ttl`** - Output skill modules are now named `ontoskill.ttl` instead of `skill.ttl`
  - Affects all path references in code and tests
  - Run `ontoskills compile --force` after upgrading to regenerate modules with new naming

### Changed

#### Perfect Mirroring Architecture

The compiler now acts as a **Semantic Bundler** - the output directory (`ontoskills/`) is a perfect, executable mirror of the input directory (`skills/`).

- **Traversal logic** - Now iterates through ALL files recursively using `rglob("*")` instead of only finding directories with `SKILL.md`
- **3-Rule File Processing**:
  - **Rule A (Core Skills)**: `SKILL.md` → compiled via LLM → `ontoskill.ttl`
  - **Rule B (Auxiliary Markdown)**: `*.md` → compiled via LLM → `*.ttl` (logged, pipeline pending)
  - **Rule C (Asset Copying)**: Non-markdown files (`.py`, `.js`, `.xsd`, etc.) → direct copy via `shutil.copy2`

#### Orphan Cleanup Enhanced

- **`clean_orphaned_files()`** - Replaces `clean_orphaned_skills()` with comprehensive mirror sync:
  - `ontoskill.ttl` → `SKILL.md` mapping
  - `*.ttl` → `*.md` mapping (auxiliary markdown)
  - Direct asset mapping (non-ttl files map to same path)
- **`SYSTEM_FILES` safeguard** - Protects compiler-generated files from cleanup:
  - `ontoskills-core.ttl` - Core TBox ontology
  - `index.ttl` - Manifest with owl:imports

### Removed

- **`clean_orphaned_skills()`** - Replaced by `clean_orphaned_files()` (no backward compatibility wrapper)
- **Legacy `skill.ttl` references** - All code and tests updated to use `ontoskill.ttl`

### Testing

- **test_storage.py** - 8 new tests for perfect mirroring:
  - `test_clean_orphaned_files_removes_orphan`
  - `test_clean_orphaned_files_preserves_valid`
  - `test_clean_orphaned_files_dry_run`
  - `test_clean_orphaned_files_preserves_system_files`
  - `test_clean_orphaned_files_removes_orphan_asset`
  - `test_clean_orphaned_files_preserves_valid_asset`
  - `test_clean_orphaned_files_auxiliary_markdown_mapping`
  - `test_clean_orphaned_files_preserves_auxiliary_with_source`
  - `test_system_files_constant`
- All existing tests updated for `ontoskill.ttl` naming
- Removed backward compatibility test

### Test Summary

- **156 tests** pass (3 deselected integration tests)

### Added

#### Core Ontology Enhancements

- **`oc:executionPath`** - New DatatypeProperty for external asset paths
  - Domain: `oc:ExecutionPayload`
  - Supports Perfect Mirroring asset bundler architecture
  - Enables referencing external script files (`.py`, `.cjs`, etc.) copied by the compiler

- **`owl:disjointWith`** - DeclarativeSkill and ExecutableSkill are now explicitly mutually exclusive
  - Enforces OWL 2 DL ($\mathcal{SROIQ}^{(D)}$) strictness
  - A skill cannot be both declarative and executable

#### SHACL Validation Updates

- **XOR constraint** - ExecutionPayload must have either `oc:code` OR `oc:executionPath`
  - `sh:or` constraint ensures at least one is present
  - Inline code or external asset path (not both required)
- **`oc:code`** - No longer strictly mandatory (minCount removed)
- **`oc:executionPath`** - New property constraint (maxCount 1, xsd:string)

## Implementation Notes

### Knowledge Architecture Framework

The extraction follows the Knowledge Architecture framework:
- **Categories of Being**: Tool, Concept, Work
- **Genus and Differentia**: "A is a B that C" definition structure
- **Relations as First-Class Citizens**: depends-on, extends, contradicts, implements, exemplifies

### OWL 2 Design Decisions

- Properties defined with characteristics for future reasoning
- Inverse properties enable bidirectional queries
- Transitive properties enable inference chains
- Asymmetric properties prevent circular dependencies

### SHACL Validation Philosophy

- **Fail-closed**: Invalid skills are never written to disk
- **Constitutional**: Shapes define the "laws" skills must follow
- **RDFS-aware**: State validation uses TBox from core ontology
- **Clear messages**: Italian error messages for debugging

### Security Philosophy

- Fail-closed: Any error blocks content
- Defense-in-depth: Regex + LLM review
- Unicode normalization prevents bypass attempts
- Pattern matching for common attack vectors
